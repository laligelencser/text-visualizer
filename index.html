            Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for
            accomplishing a
            specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling
            algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming
            language (commonly referred to as coding)[1][2]. The source code of a program is written in one or more
            languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the
            central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate
            the
            performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a
            given
            problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including
            knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

            Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance,
            implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer
            programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development
            is
            used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual
            writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.
            Reverse engineering is the opposite process. A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their
            technical
            knowledge to overcome a problem, but it can also mean a security hacker in common language.

            Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1106 AD, when the automata of Al-Jazari were
            programmable, via pegs and cams, to play various rhythms and drum patterns;[3] and the 1801 Jacquard loom
            could
            produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes
            punched in
            them.

            However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an
            algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's
            Analytical Engine.[4]


            Data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged in
            program decks.
            In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[5] Later a
            control
            panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by
            the
            late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a
            similar way; as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program
            computers
            introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer
            memory.[citation needed]

            Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine,
            often
            in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a
            text
            format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying
            addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine
            language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.

            High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less
            bound to
            the underlying hardware. FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional
            implementation,
            came out in 1957[6] and many other languages were soon developed â€“ in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial
            data
            processing, and Lisp for computer research.

            Programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or paper tape. See computer programming in the punch
            card
            era. By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs
            could be created by typing directly into the computers. Text editors were developed that allowed changes and
            corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards.
